# OAuth KV Storage Schema

This document describes the schema used in the OAUTH_KV storage for the OAuth 2.0 provider library. The library uses Cloudflare Workers KV to store all OAuth-related data, including client registrations, authorization grants, and tokens.

## Overview

The OAUTH_KV namespace stores several types of objects, each with a distinct key prefix to identify the type of data. The storage leverages KV's built-in TTL (Time-To-Live) functionality for automatic expiration of short-lived data like tokens and authorization codes.

The system implements end-to-end encryption for sensitive application-specific properties (`props`) to ensure that only holders of valid tokens can access this data.

## Key Naming Conventions

All keys in the KV namespace follow a consistent pattern to make them easily identifiable:

| Prefix | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `client:` | Client registration data | `client:abc123` |
| `grant:{userId}:` | Authorization grant data | `grant:user123:xyz789` |
| `token:` | Access and refresh tokens | `token:ghi789` |

## Data Structures

### Clients

Client records store OAuth client application information.

**Key format:** `client:{clientId}`

**Content Example:**
```json
{
  "clientId": "abc123",
  "clientSecret": "5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8",
  "redirectUris": ["https://app.example.com/callback"],
  "clientName": "Example App",
  "logoUri": "https://app.example.com/logo.png",
  "clientUri": "https://app.example.com",
  "policyUri": "https://app.example.com/privacy",
  "tosUri": "https://app.example.com/terms",
  "jwksUri": null,
  "contacts": ["dev@example.com"],
  "grantTypes": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
  "responseTypes": ["code"],
  "registrationDate": 1644256123
}
```

> **Note:** The `clientSecret` is stored as a SHA-256 hash, not in plaintext. The actual secret is only returned to the client when initially created or updated, and never stored.

**TTL:** No expiration (persistent storage)

### Authorization Grants

Grant records store information about permissions a user has granted to an application, along with the authorization code (initially) and refresh token (after code exchange).

**Key format:** `grant:{userId}:{grantId}`

**Content Example (during authorization):**
```json
{
  "id": "xyz789",
  "clientId": "abc123",
  "userId": "user123",
  "scope": ["document.read", "document.write"],
  "metadata": {
    "label": "My Files Access",
    "deviceInfo": "Chrome on Windows"
  },
  "encryptedProps": "AES-GCM encrypted base64-encoded string",
  "createdAt": 1644256123,
  "authCodeId": "5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8",
  "authCodeWrappedKey": "base64-encoded wrapped encryption key",
  "codeChallenge": "E9Melhoa2OwvFrEMTJguCHaoeK1t8URWbuGJSstw-cM",
  "codeChallengeMethod": "S256"
}
```

**Content Example (after code exchange):**
```json
{
  "id": "xyz789",
  "clientId": "abc123",
  "userId": "user123",
  "scope": ["document.read", "document.write"],
  "metadata": {
    "label": "My Files Access",
    "deviceInfo": "Chrome on Windows"
  },
  "encryptedProps": "AES-GCM encrypted base64-encoded string",
  "createdAt": 1644256123,
  "refreshTokenId": "5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8",
  "refreshTokenWrappedKey": "base64-encoded wrapped encryption key"
}
```

**Content Example (after refresh token rotation):**
```json
{
  "id": "xyz789",
  "clientId": "abc123",
  "userId": "user123",
  "scope": ["document.read", "document.write"],
  "metadata": {
    "label": "My Files Access",
    "deviceInfo": "Chrome on Windows"
  },
  "encryptedProps": "AES-GCM encrypted base64-encoded string",
  "createdAt": 1644256123,
  "refreshTokenId": "7f2ab876c546a9e9f988ba7645af78239cfe980a4231ab38fcb895cb244a0a12",
  "refreshTokenWrappedKey": "base64-encoded wrapped encryption key",
  "previousRefreshTokenId": "5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8",
  "previousRefreshTokenWrappedKey": "base64-encoded wrapped encryption key for previous token"
}
```

**TTL:**
- Initially 10 minutes (during authorization process)
- No expiration after the authorization code is exchanged for tokens

> **Note:** The grant record includes the hash of the authorization code initially, which is replaced by the hash of the refresh token after the code is exchanged. The record also has a TTL during the authorization process, which is removed when the code is exchanged for tokens to make the grant permanent.

### Tokens

Token records store metadata about issued access tokens, including denormalized grant information for faster access.

**Key format:** `token:{userId}:{grantId}:{tokenId}`

**Content Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "ghi789",
  "grantId": "xyz789",
  "userId": "user123",
  "createdAt": 1644256123,
  "expiresAt": 1644259723,
  "wrappedEncryptionKey": "base64-encoded wrapped encryption key",
  "grant": {
    "clientId": "abc123",
    "scope": ["document.read", "document.write"],
    "encryptedProps": "AES-GCM encrypted base64-encoded string"
  }
}
```

> **Note:** The token format is `{userId}:{grantId}:{random-secret}` which embeds the identifiers needed for efficient lookups. The token key format includes the user ID and grant ID to enable efficient revocation of all tokens for a specific grant. The token record contains denormalized grant information to eliminate the need for a separate grant lookup during token validation. The token also carries a wrapped encryption key that can only be unwrapped using the actual token string, allowing decryption of the encrypted props.

**TTL:** Access tokens typically have a 1 hour (3600 seconds) TTL by default

## Security Considerations

1. **Sensitive Value Storage**: No sensitive values are stored in plaintext in KV storage:
   - Access tokens and refresh tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes
   - Client secrets are stored as SHA-256 hashes
   - Authorization codes are stored as SHA-256 hashes
   - For PKCE, only the code challenge is stored, never the code verifier
   - Application-specific properties (`props`) are encrypted using AES-GCM

   This ensures that even if the KV data is compromised, the actual sensitive values cannot be retrieved.

2. **End-to-End Encryption for Props**:
   - Each grant has its own unique AES-256 key for encrypting props
   - A constant all-zero initialization vector (IV) is used with AES-GCM encryption
   - This is cryptographically secure because each key is only used exactly once
   - Using unique keys eliminates the IV randomization requirement of AES-GCM
   - The encryption key is wrapped (encrypted) using each token as key material
   - The wrapped key can only be unwrapped by someone with the actual token
   - No backup of the encryption key is stored anywhere
   - Even system administrators cannot decrypt the props without a valid token

3. **Key Wrapping Security**:
   - Token wrapping keys are derived using HMAC-SHA256 with a static key
   - The derivation method is different from token ID generation for security separation
   - Each token type (authorization code, refresh token, access token) has its own wrapped key
   - The wrapping algorithm used is AES-KW (AES Key Wrap)

4. **Token Format**: Tokens use the format `{userId}:{grantId}:{random-secret}` which allows:
   - Direct access to token records without needing to look up grants separately
   - Verification that the token was issued for the specific grant and user
   - Enhanced security through proper validation checks

5. **TTL-based Expiration**: Access tokens automatically expire using KV's TTL feature, reducing the need for manual cleanup.

6. **Efficient Storage**:
   - Refresh tokens are stored within the grant records, eliminating redundant storage
   - Grant data is denormalized into token records for faster validation
   - Token keys include user ID and grant ID to enable efficient revocation

7. **Structured Key Design**: The key format `token:{userId}:{grantId}:{tokenId}` enables:
   - Efficient revocation of all tokens for a specific grant
   - Easy lookup of all tokens issued to a specific user
   - Clean organization of the key-value namespace

8. **Cryptographic Hash Verification**: When validating credentials, the system hashes the provided value and compares it with the stored hash, rather than comparing plaintext values.

## Example Workflow with Encrypted Props

1. A client is registered, creating a `client:{clientId}` entry with a hashed client secret.

2. A user authorizes the client, creating a `grant:{userId}:{grantId}` entry that includes:
   - The hashed authorization code in the `authCodeId` field
   - PKCE code challenge and method (if PKCE is used)
   - A new AES-256 encryption key is generated specifically for this grant
   - The `props` data is encrypted using this key with AES-GCM and a constant zero IV
   - The encryption key is wrapped using the authorization code
   - The wrapped key is stored in `authCodeWrappedKey`
   - A 10-minute TTL on the grant record

3. The client exchanges the authorization code for tokens:
   - The code is validated by comparing its hash to the one stored in the grant
   - If PKCE was used, the code_verifier is validated against the stored code_challenge
   - The encryption key is unwrapped using the authorization code
   - The key is re-wrapped for both the access token and refresh token
   - The `authCodeId`, `authCodeWrappedKey`, and PKCE fields are removed from the grant
   - A refresh token is generated and its hash is stored in the grant's `refreshTokenId` field
   - The wrapped key for the refresh token is stored in `refreshTokenWrappedKey`
   - The grant's TTL is removed, making it permanent
   - A new access token is generated and stored as `token:{userId}:{grantId}:{accessTokenId}` 
   - The access token record includes the encrypted props, IV, and wrapped key
   - Both tokens are returned to the client

4. When the client makes API requests with the access token:
   - The system looks up the token directly using the structured key format
   - The wrapped encryption key is unwrapped using the access token
   - The props are decrypted using the unwrapped key
   - The decrypted props are made available to the API handler

5. Access tokens expire automatically after their TTL.

6. Refresh tokens do not expire and are stored directly in the grant; they remain valid until the grant is revoked.
   - For security, the provider issues a new refresh token with each refresh operation
   - It keeps track of both the current and previous tokens, along with their wrapped keys
   - When the new token is used, the previous token is invalidated, but can still be used until replaced

7. When a grant is revoked:
   - All associated access tokens are found using the key prefix `token:{userId}:{grantId}:` and deleted
   - The grant record is deleted, which also effectively revokes the refresh token and all encrypted data

## Implementation Notes

- For high-traffic applications, consider using a caching layer in front of KV to reduce read operations on frequently accessed data.
- Monitor KV usage metrics to ensure you stay within Cloudflare's limits for your plan.
- The design uses KV's `list()` capability with key prefixes to efficiently query related data like all grants for a user, eliminating the need for separate list indexes.
- If a grant is revoked, associated tokens are not immediately deleted from KV, but rely on TTL expiration. Add a cleanup process if immediate revocation is required.
